I believe my database is in 3rd normal form because it follows the rules of normal form. It is in 1st normal form since every table contains atomic information. An example of this is the decomposition of address for the People table. My database is in 2nd normal form because it follows 1st normal form and all columns depend on the whole key, avoiding partial key dependencies. Most of the tables have a single column for the primary key, where Teams and HeadCoachRoster do not have other columns to depend on a partial key. My database is in 3rd normal form because it follows 2nd normal form and all non-key columns depend on other non-key columns. Avoiding insert, delete, and update anomalies will put my database in BCNF, but not sure how to prove that without specific test data.
